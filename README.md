As per the requirement, below tasks are created using this custom module:<br/>

- A new text field named "Site API key" added to the "Site Information" form. 
- Given "No API Key yet" as placeholder text for the field.
- This field is given as a mandatory field.
- When the form is submitted, this value saved as system variable named "siteapikey".

- A URL "/jsonrepnode/{siteapikey}/{nid}" is provided to output JSON object of the node using the Site API key and node id.
